# Employee Directory

A lightweight frontend employee directory app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Freemarker-style templates.

## How to Run
Open `dashboard.ftlh` or convert it to `index.html` and open in any browser.
I installed live server to run my project.

## Features
- List, Add, Edit, Delete employees
- Search employees by name/email
- Pagination
- Responsive layout

## Folder Structure
- `templates/`: Freemarker-style HTML templates
- `css/`: Stylesheets
- `js/`: JavaScript logic

## Screenshots
*Add screenshots of dashboard, form, and mobile view here*

## Reflection
This project demonstrates modular JS, client-side rendering, DOM manipulation, and Freemarker-style templating. Would improve UI polish and add animations if given more time.
